# PythonTest
for week 6/7

What the code does:

Takes user name, age, and location to output a message to the user.
Then takes two integer inputs and performs math operations on them and outputs the results.

How to use the code:

To use it, run the program and answer the prompts.
The code will generate and output answers on its own.

How to contribute to the project:

For general documentation about contributing to the project, please refer to the code of conduct
You can copy and redistribute the code in any way possible as long as you change the name of it.
To fork code, please follow git's documentation here: https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo

Explanation:

We picked the license because it was simple and easy for our purposes. Also, the name was funny. Anyone
can have their own version of the code as long as they change the name.

We picked the code of conduct because it seems industry standard. Mozilla and Google both use it for their
open source project.
